This installer is only needed for domain-joined clients.

See https://github.com/BYUHPC/oodproxy/wiki/Install-oodproxybyu-client-software for more information.

To build this installer, download the .iss file, open in inno installer and build.  This is a separate installer from the main installer. It must be installed first and requires admin privileges.  It is not necessary unless the client machine is a member of a domain.
